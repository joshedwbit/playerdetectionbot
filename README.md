# playerdetectionbot
A bot to continually check the world map for the presence of other online players, if one is detected, the bot immediately instructs my character to log out/change world.

The purpose of this bot is to protect my account from being reported (which may result in my account being banned), while I use other bots to give me an in game advantage.
The goal is to completely avoid other players to minimise my chances of being banned.
